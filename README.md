### Overview: 

The Library API provides users a convenient way to manage inventory on books and track checkouts based on particular user roles. The Library API features various endpoints with numerous functions, such as viewing inventory and checking books out, that are critical in any library setting; refer to ‘API Endpoints’ below for full details on endpoints. Because all of the transactions in the Library API is persistently stored using a database, there is no need to worry about data-loss, corruption, or running out of storage space! The Library API is a simple, yet powerful tool that can act as the foundation of any professional library institution.
